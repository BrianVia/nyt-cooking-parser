    "description": "How can you make runny-yolked fried eggs even better? Give them edges of crisp, salty Parmesan. The addition takes just a few extra minutes and adds an incredible layer to a dish that’s already deeply lovable. Make sure to skip preground Parmesan here: You’ll want to shred the cheese yourself on the largest holes of your grater. And use a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast-iron pan to fry the eggs. They may never come off a regular pan. Eat them alone, lay them over asparagus, or use them to top <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020276-crispy-parmesan-eggs-with-radicchio-and-pea-salad\">a sharp, lemony salad</a>. When something’s this perfect, it’s hard to go wrong however you serve it.",
